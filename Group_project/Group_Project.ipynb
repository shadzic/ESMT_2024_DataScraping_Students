    "In this project, you will create a Business that utilizes various APIs to make informed decisions about running your local business. If you want to sell drinks or street food or whatever floats your boat, do not hesitate to find your data and design the project accordingly. You will collect data from meteorological and non-meteorological APIs to help your business determine when, where, and how much inventory is needed to maximize sales. "
